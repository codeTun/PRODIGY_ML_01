# House Price Prediction Project

This project is a task from my internship at Prodigy Infotech, focused on machine learning using linear regression to predict house prices. The dataset and challenge are from Kaggle's [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Files Included

- **house_price_prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code.
- **submission.csv**: Submission file for Kaggle competition.

## Dataset

The dataset used is from Kaggle's competition, accessible at the [House Prices competition overview](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `house_price_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
3. Run the notebook to see the predictions and explore the code.

## Contributing

Contributions are not typically expected for internship tasks, but feel free to fork the repository and modify the code for learning purposes.
